	Works Cites section
- need to find a political classifier
- how easy is it to get the twitter handles for all members of Congress?
- is there a tool where you can input a past twitter names and the output
	is their twitter ID number?

Sentiment Analysis -- Jurafsky MOOC (unit 3)
https://class.coursera.org/nlp/lecture


Play with data mining classification. (wait for Stephen on this)





Lit search:
-----------
(Always search on (1) ProQuest, (2) EBSCOhost Academic Search Complete, and
(3) Google Scholar.)


"Cornerstones":

Dynamic (evolving) networks. How are they represented? What graph invariants
are used for them?

Sentiment analysis: auto-classifying text as "liberal" or "conservative."
(There's just got to be stuff for this. Maybe there's even stuff for Tweets
specifically??)

"opinion dynamics." Also, "bounds of confidence," which seems to mean "agents
being influenced by other agents only to the degree that they have some level
of confidence in them."


"Competitors":

Find everything you can on measuring political polarization (or, if nothing
specific to that, *any* kind of polarization / attribute assortativity) in
social networks

Find everything you can on the effect of "crusader nodes"; i.e., how much
effect can nodes have that are deliberately introduced into a social network?
(Tough to know in advance what the terms will be, but I would think there has
to be stuff on this. Basically, the degree of influence of particular nodes,
and estimating how much a graph would change by the presence of a new node
with particular properties.)



Synthetic data:
---------------

Start to play with RDPGs.




Real data:
----------

Write down unambiguously "what our precise Twitter data needs are."
(HZ take a first cut.)

Load and explore Dave's political blog graphs (see github data folder)

Here's a good task: compute the attribute assortativity on both graphs, using
"value" as the attribute, to get an estimate of the "polarization" of the
graph.


Do a reboot in your mind about "what are all the ways we can get data from
Twitter?" (e.g., all tweets from user X? all followers/followees of user X?
all tweets with certain text match? streaming API? is there a time frame
(like, any tweets older than t won't be available)?


Do a reboot in your mind of "what are all the interpretations we might assign
to an edge in a Twitter graph?" follower/followee? mentions? something else?


Do some thinking and Googling and exploring Twitter, and consider the
question: "what's the best way for us to get a manageable but 'real' subset of
Twitter users who are reasonably well-connected to each other and who can
reliably be judged as 'liberal' or 'conservative'?"
