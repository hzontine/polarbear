    Wouldn't it be cool to explore this research topic sometime? (but NOT spring.)

    It would be interesting if the HM model tends to result in more extreme
course reversals than plain old BVM.

HZ - dust off binary.voter(). add code to run binary.voter() a bunch of
times and detect course reversals. Then run the original Holley sim a bunch of
times, plotting only the time series fraction-of-liberals, and see whether
there are any course reversals.

    - first, figure out how often this course reversal happens

    - "turn off" the variable interaction by making expressed only affect
      expressed and hidden only affect hidden. Verify that you see convergence
      to uniformity by both variables (which could converge to the same
      opinion or to the opposite) but that you never see course reversal.
