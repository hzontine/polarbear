I. Introduction
	a. "social bubble"
	b. Why should we care if the American public is becoming polarized?
II. Lit search
	a. The Great Debate: Polarization
		i. Converse's "The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics" 1964
			1) Based on his analysis of the 1956 and 1960 American Elections
			2) The vast majority of ordinary voters show little evidence of using an ideological 
			framework to evaluate political parties and their candidates.
			3) The majority have a limited understanding of the basic concepts of liberalism and conservatism.
			4) Only a small minority of elites have the ability or education to deeply understand.
			5) Political and cultural divisions within the American public have deepened considerably since the 1970s.
		ii. Saunders and Abramowitz: Polarization is real!
SD: Find a definition of "elite."
SD: Find a definition of "polarization." Are there competing definitions, or does everyone agree?
SD: Big picture -- what kinds of techniques are they using to determine "how polarized a group is"; does this have anything to do with social networks
			1) Wrote "Is Polarization a Myth?" (2008), ""Ideological realignment in the U.S. Electorate" (1998) and more
			2) Growing elite polarization has led to an increase in ideological awareness and polarization among the public
SD: Any impact of WWW and social networks here?
				a) Cited in their 1998 article
				b) Findings backed by Hetherington 2001, Layman and Carsey 2002
			3) Such political divisions reflect differences in religious beliefs and practices as well as deep-seated psychological orientations
				a) Layman 1997, 2001; Layman and Carmines 1997;  Jost 2006
			4) Can be explained by ideological polarization among party supporters in the electorate.
				a) Jacobson 2000
		iii. Fiorina: Polarization is not real!
			1) Wrote "Polarization in the American Public" (2008), "Why Can't We All Get Along?" (2005), "Disconnected: The Political Class vs the 
			People" (2006), "Culture War? The Myth of Polarized America", and more
			2) Cites that Converse's portrait of the American electorate is pretty accurate
			3) The ideological disputes that engage political elites and activists have little resonance among the masses. Americans are "not very 
			well-informed about politics, don't hold views of their own very strongly,  and are not ideological' ("Culture War?")
			4) The American public is moderate: closely divided but not deeply divided
			5) Differences between Liberal and Conservative identifiers on issues has increase slightly. Partisan polarization is an elite phenomenon. 
			Only the elites are truly polarized in their views.
			6) Divisions in the public based on religious beliefs and practices have increased, while divisions based on social characteristics 
			(age, race, gender) have decreased.
		iv. Saunders and Abramowitz vs. Fiorina
			1) Other opinions?
	b. Political Polarization on Twitter
		i. Predicting polarization
			1) Inferring ideology based on connectedness on the graph
				a) What are the main techniques used to infer this? 
					- Pennebaker, Chung, and Ireland 2007
						1) They collected all tweets that contained the names of either the 6 parties (German study) or selected 
						prominent politicians of these parties.
						2) LIWC2007 (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count): a text analysis software developed to assess emotional, cognitive, 
						and structural components of text samples using a psychometrically validated internal dictionary. 
					- 
				b) What are the main conclusions that have been drawn?
					- Many classifiers report accuracy rates 30% higher than can be expected in populations of general Twitter users.	
						("Classifying Political Orientation on Twitter")
					- 

			2) Determining ideology based on Sentiment Analysis of the words in a user's tweets
				a) What are the main techniques used to infer this? 
				
				b) What are the main conclusions that have been drawn?
