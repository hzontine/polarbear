Sanity check items:
-------------------
When you crank up HTI, you should see a consistent poll bias in favor of
Popular. When you dial it down it to zero, you should see no consistent poll
bias in either direction. (CONFIRM)




Identify CLEARLY in your mind what each of the i.v.'s are. Ask yourself: "when
I crank this to the extremes, what ought to be the effect?"
