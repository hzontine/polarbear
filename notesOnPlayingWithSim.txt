Sanity check items:
-------------------
When you crank up HTI, you should see a consistent poll bias in favor of
Popular. When you dial it down it to zero, you should see no consistent poll
bias in either direction. (HZ- CONFIRMED)


Identify CLEARLY in your mind what each of the IV's are.
When I crank this to the extremes, what ought to be the effect?"
-----

*** Probability to give into peer pressure
With HTE on and internalize opinion at 0.5.

- 0.01:
Red should never feel pressure to change their external to match another.
Interesting seeds: 207, 205

- 1.00:
Red should always be change their opinion when they interact with blue.
Interesting seeds: 7446

*** Probability to internalize your expressed opinion
With HTE and peer pressure at 0.5.
- 0.01:
Expressed opinions should never be internalized. So peer pressuring will never 
result in the influence of an agent's hidden opinion. Only the anonymous 
process will effect hidden opinions.
Interesting seeds: 6275, 122, 2322, 4575

- 1.00: 
If everybody always internalizes their opinion, I would expect to see internal 
opinions to pretty much always match the external opinions. Blue should 
always end up winning.
