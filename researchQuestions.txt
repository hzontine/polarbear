Some possible research questions:
---------------------------------

1) Can the HM produce a hidden/expressed difference as great as we have seen
in the Trump election?

2) Does a population that interacts according to the HM increase or decrease
in genuineness over time?




Postponed) Does the HM have a tendency toward more extreme course reversals
than BVM?
