3/     HZ    Cor.test()
                - x as probabilities, y as bias vectors 

           
            10 plots(10%-100%) = For a given ending point (80/90), for each probability (x-axis) plot each of 50 seeds current value
                * 10% = At iteration 1000

            * look into the literature for prob connected between agents and its effect on convergence rate

             Take a look at assortativity. Why isn't it changing much? Is this a bug? A graph scale problem? A finding?

2/24   HZ    Read Claudio paper.

       HZ    Read Moscovici paper.


The deep future:
3/??   HZ    Implement different starting graph types (ER, Barabasi, Watts-Strogatz)
3/??   HZ    Implement stubborn vs. not, and % of stubborn agents (Note to
             self: should this be two %'s, one for Pop and one for Unpop?)
