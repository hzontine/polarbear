       HZ    Sanity check -- play with prob connected between agents. More connected, the slower
                it should take to reach uniformity.
                * look into the literature

       HZ    Param sweep plot---- 
             Graph the prob internalize vs. the max it gets away from 50/50. When it is at 0,
                graph can reach uniformity, but if it is at 1, will not converge.

       HZ    Write 'The Model At Its Extremes' section

2/22   HZ    Determine whether model reaches equilibrium (reaches a steady state) with regards to: (1)
             assortativity (2) poll bias.
                * specfically, when it does not converge (gets more polarized)
                * what does the poll bias look like when the model refuses to converge

3/??   HZ    Implement stubborn vs. not, and % of stubborn agents (Note to
             self: should this be two %'s, one for Pop and one for Unpop?)

3/??   HZ    Implement different starting graph types (ER, Barabasi, Watts-Strogatz)

       SD    How is original BVM impacted by density of starting graph? (Does
             it converge more or less quickly if more edges?)


Meetings:
Mon 2/20 -- Talk about who we need to email. Check out true believer graphs.
Wed 2/22 -- Go over sections 2. ("OD models") and 2.1 ("BMV" and its main results)
Fri 2/24 -- Go over section 3. (the "Hidden Trump Model")
Mon 2/?? -- Go over section 4. (the "model at its extremes")
