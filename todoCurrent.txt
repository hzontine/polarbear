2/13  SD/HZ  *Fix Shiny app which only refreshes top graph.

2/13   HZ    *Spend solid quality time with the Shiny app playing with it to see what
                affects what and how.

2/8    HZ    **Define the research question. Write it down. Memorize it.
                ("Something we can talk about" by this date. Don't worry about perfection.)

2/8    HZ    **Identify and rigorously define the dependent variable(s). (Write it down.)

2/8    HZ    **Identify and list the independent variables. (Write it down.)

2/10   HZ    Read and classify papers from CSSSA/WSC.
                - Joseph Harrison dissertation

2/15   HZ    Come up with a one-sentence capture of "why we want to talk to" each person on our
                CSSSA/WSC list.

2/17   HZ    Implement the "Hidden Trump Influence" (HTI) aspect to the model (that can be
                turned on and off). when on, the model now becomes inherently asymmetric.

2/13   HZ    *Add a "poll bias over time" graph. (How far off are expressed vs. hidden) Note:
                only one line -- "how much higher is expressed-blue than hidden-blue?"




Meetings:
Wed -- Talk about research question and variables.
Fri -- Talk about paper classification and where we're at.
Mon -- Meet and go over findings from informal Shiny app play sessions.
