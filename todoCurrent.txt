       HZ    Sanity check -- play with prob connected between agents. More connected, the slower
                it should take to reach uniformity.
                * look into the literature

2/20   HZ    Add 2 graphs of true believers
                * hidden: out of the hidden blues, what % are expressed blue? (and red)
                * expressed: out of exp blues, what % are expressed blue? (and red)

       HZ    Separate plot--- 
             Graph the prob internalize vs. the max it gets away from 50/50. When it is at 0,
                graph can reach uniformity, but if it is at 1, will not converge.

       HZ    Write 'The Model At Its Extremes' section

2/22   HZ    Determine whether model reaches equilibrium (reaches a steady state) with regards to: (1)
             assortativity (2) poll bias.

2/20   HZ    Read and classify papers from CSSSA/WSC.

2/20   HZ    Come up with a one-sentence capture of "why we want to talk to" each person on our
                CSSSA/WSC list.

3/??   HZ    Implement stubborn vs. not, and % of stubborn agents (Note to
             self: should this be two %'s, one for Pop and one for Unpop?)

3/??   HZ    Implement different starting graph types (ER, Barabasi, Watts-Strogatz)

       SD    How is original BVM impacted by density of starting graph? (Does
             it converge more or less quickly if more edges?)


Meetings:
Tue 2/14 -- Meet and go over findings from informal Shiny app play sessions.
Wed 2/15 -- Show Stephen your screen grabs of extreme cases.
            Discuss conclusion about "does HTE model converge?"
Fri 2/17 -- Dicuss the effect on the model that the turning on/off the three probabilities has.
                * chart.txt
Mon 2/20 -- Talk about paper classification and where we're at. Go over equilibrium findings.
Wed 2/22 -- Go over sections 2. ("OD models") and 2.1 ("BMV" and its main results)
Fri 2/24 -- Go over section 3. (the "Hidden Trump Model")
Mon 2/?? -- Go over section 4. (the "model at its extremes")
