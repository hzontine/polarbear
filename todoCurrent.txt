2/15   HZ    *Add a "poll bias over time" graph. (How far off are expressed vs. hidden) Note:
                only one line -- "how much higher is expressed-blue than hidden-blue?"

2/17   HZ    *Determine whether model reaches equilibrium with regards to: (1)
             assortativity (2) poll bias.

2/15   HZ    *Do some screen grabs of representative "extreme" cases for your
             thesis.

2/15   HZ    *Convince ourselves that the HTE model is a fourth way of not
                reaching uniformity of opinion.

2/17   HZ    Read and classify papers from CSSSA/WSC.
                - Joseph Harrison dissertation

2/17   HZ    Come up with a one-sentence capture of "why we want to talk to" each person on our
                CSSSA/WSC list.

3/??   HZ    Implement stubborn vs. not, and % of stubborn agents (Note to
             self: should this be two %'s, one for Pop and one for Unpop?)

3/??   HZ    Implement different starting graph types (ER, Barabasi, Watts-Strogatz)

       SD    How is original BVM impacted by density of starting graph? (Does
             it converge more or less quickly if more edges?)


Meetings:
Tue 2/14 -- Meet and go over findings from informal Shiny app play sessions.
Wed 2/15 -- Show Stephen your screen grabs of extreme cases.
            Discuss conclusion about "does HTE model converge?"
Fri 2/17 -- Meet and go over equilibrium findings.
Mon 2/20 -- Talk about paper classification and where we're at.
