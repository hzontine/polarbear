3/24   HZ    Param sweeps:
                For all sweeps, do 20 values instead of 10. (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, etc.)
                For all sweeps, hold two other interacting probs at 0.5 and prob connection at 0.25.
                * Prob connected between agents. (More connected, the slower
                it should take to reach uniformity.)  *see also lit lookup action item
                * Peer pressure (plot vs. poll bias; see Stephen's checkin)
                * Prob internalize
                * Prob update

            * look into the literature for prob connected between agents and its effect on convergence rate

             Take a look at assortativity. Why isn't it changing much? Is this a bug? A graph scale problem? A finding?

2/24   HZ    Read Claudio paper.

       HZ    Read Moscovici paper.


The deep future:
3/??   HZ    Implement different starting graph types (ER, Barabasi, Watts-Strogatz)
3/??   HZ    Implement stubborn vs. not, and % of stubborn agents (Note to
             self: should this be two %'s, one for Pop and one for Unpop?)
