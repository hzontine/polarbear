2/17   HZ    Write up sanity check section -
                * Our implementation causing the model to never reach uniformity:
                    * two processes effecting the system      
                    * we expect further polarization if we increase update and 
                    internalize but decrease peer pressure 0
                        * this simulates the increased influence of online social
                            influence, as opposed to face2face interactions.

2/20   HZ    Determine whether model reaches equilibrium with regards to: (1)
             assortativity (2) poll bias.

2/20   HZ    Read and classify papers from CSSSA/WSC.

2/20   HZ    Come up with a one-sentence capture of "why we want to talk to" each person on our
                CSSSA/WSC list.

3/??   HZ    Implement stubborn vs. not, and % of stubborn agents (Note to
             self: should this be two %'s, one for Pop and one for Unpop?)

3/??   HZ    Implement different starting graph types (ER, Barabasi, Watts-Strogatz)

       SD    How is original BVM impacted by density of starting graph? (Does
             it converge more or less quickly if more edges?)


Meetings:
Tue 2/14 -- Meet and go over findings from informal Shiny app play sessions.
Wed 2/15 -- Show Stephen your screen grabs of extreme cases.
            Discuss conclusion about "does HTE model converge?"
Fri 2/17 -- Dicuss the effect on the model that the turning on/off the three probabilities has.
                * chart.txt
Mon 2/20 -- Talk about paper classification and where we're at. Go over equilibrium findings.
