(January 2017 Reboot)

Review correspondence from CSSSA/WSC people. Who should we be contacting?
    - Look for email from Yining (maybe??) where I said "I'm busy, but will
      get back to you soon (in January?)"

Read and classify papers from CSSSA/WSC.
    - Joseph Harrison dissertation

Chase down references that claim to have any data at all (even if just
    qualitative or anecdotal) that there was indeed a hidden Trump effect

Is there anyone from Social Psych we should touch base with to verify the
basic model processes?

Define the research question. Write it down. Memorize it.

Identify and rigorously define the dependent variable(s).

Identify and list the independent variables.

Play with sim interactively for as long as it takes to decide what we want
formal test data for. (It's too early to do parameter sweeps now.)

Create a Shiny app to do the above^^^





Postpone this: course reversals
    It would be interesting if the HM model tends to result in more extreme
course reversals than plain old BVM.

HZ - dust off binary.voter(). add code to run binary.voter() a bunch of
times and detect course reversals. Then run the original Holley sim a bunch of
times, plotting only the time series fraction-of-liberals, and see whether
there are any course reversals.

    - first, figure out how often this course reversal happens

    - "turn off" the variable interaction by making expressed only affect
      expressed and hidden only affect hidden. Verify that you see convergence
      to uniformity by both variables (which could converge to the same
      opinion or to the opposite) but that you never see course reversal.
