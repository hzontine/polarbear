HZ - dust off binary.voter(). add code to run binary.voter() a bunch of
times and detect course reversals. Then run the original Holley sim a bunch of
times, plotting only the time series fraction-of-liberals, and see whether
there are any course reversals.

    - first, figure out how often this course reversal happens

    - "turn off" the variable interaction by making expressed only affect
      expressed and hidden only affect hidden. Verify that you see convergence
      to uniformity by both variables (which could converge to the same
      opinion or to the opposite) but that you never see course reversal.


HZ - Set the seed based on system clock and then output it to screen at some
point in the sim (so we can recreate results).


HZ - Plot the genuineness percentage over time. (What % of people have a
matching expressed and hidden?)


HZ - Verify that the following statement is true: it is impossible to get a
model to "reverse course" (i.e., liberals ahead of conservatives, but then the
conservatives make a comeback, or vice versa) without having expressed and
hidden as two separate variables.


SD - Make the node border widths wider:
