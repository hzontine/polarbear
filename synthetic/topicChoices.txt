Latent vs expressed opinions
    - "the hidden Trump vote"
    - two different ways in which people are influenced:
        1. anonymously (chat room -ish)
        2. non-anonymously (social connections)
    - how do the two variables affect each other?
        a. the Hannah effect: some probability that you'll get guts enough to
            express what you actually feel
        b. the Stephen effect: other people's expressed opinions can change
            your latent opinion (as well as your expressed of course)
    - a dial: how often do you interact in 1 v 2 mode
    - a dial: how much more convincing is a non-anonymous person
    - maybe "aligned" people (expressed==latent) are more influential (or more
          stubborn?)


Third party: how much of a seed group does there need to be for a third-party
    to gain traction in an all blue-and-red graph?

Stephen model
    - Alignment of opinions  ("packaging of opinions")


Stubbornness
    - Partial stubbornness



Dynamic networks
    - The Dave model
    - The "Encounter model" -- nodes periodically encounter people from the
      population at large, and use homophily to help decide whether to become
      friends
    - Is there research in this?? Why haven't we found it? (Look for "dynamic
      networks" "dynamic graphs")


Ways to freaking get non-uniformity
    Low Bounded confidence threshold
    Latent opinions
    Stubbornness
    ??? Did Hannah and Stephen just come up with a fourth way?? The HTE model
may not ever reach uniformity depending on parameters (the face2face effect
keeps the population from ever completely tipping?)
