model variations:
-----------------

how are opinions represented?
    - univariate 
X         Binary: (Yildiz, Acemoglu 2011) 
X         Continuous: (Ghaderi, Srikant 2012)   (Deffuant 2000)
    - vector of opinions
        Binary: (Deffuant 2000)
        Continuous: 
how are the vertices that you encounter chosen?
    - pairwise
X        - chosen uniformly from the global graph
X        - chosen from graph neighbors (Yildiz, Acemoglui 2011) (Follmer 1974)
         - SD/HZ variant: weighted probability between global and neighbors
    - group influence (HK model)

how effectual are encounters?
X    - conversions happen on every encounter
X    - conversions happen only with fixed probability
     - there is a prob. of converting which is inversely proportional to node's
       in-degree (i.e., if you're following a zillion people, it's less likely
       you'll be influenced by each one because that one person only occupies a
       small fraction of the ideas you're exposed to) (??)
    - different nodes have different "stubbornness" attribute (Yildiz, Acemoglu 2011)
        Question: can/should the "degree of activeness on Twitter" be modeled?
        (More likely to be influenced the more tweets you see.)
        - different ways to implement stubbornness:
            - migration factor is lower for stubborn nodes
            - BC thresh is lower for stubborn nodes
            - is stubbornness a binary or continuous attribute?
            - do nodes become stubborn over time?

Big question: does the graph change over time??
