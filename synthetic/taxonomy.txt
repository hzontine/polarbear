model variations:
-----------------

how are opinions represented?
    - univariate 
X       Binary: (Yildiz et al. 2013) (Folmer 1974) (Weisbuch and Boudjema 1999)
           * Binary Voter Model: (Holley and Liggett 1975) and (Clifford and Sudbury 1973)
X       Discrete: (Yildiz et al. 2011)
X       Continuous: (Ghaderi, Srikant 2012)   (Deffuant 2000) (Weisbuch et al. 2001)
    - vector of opinions
        Binary: (Deffuant 2000)
        Continuous: (Sirbu et al. 2013) 
how are the vertices that you encounter chosen?
    - pairwise
X        - chosen uniformly from the global graph (Weisbuch et al. 2001) 
X        - chosen from graph neighbors (Yildiz, Acemoglui 2011) (Follmer 1974)
         - SD/HZ variant: weighted probability between global and neighbors
    - group influence (HK model)

how effectual are encounters?
X    - conversions happen on every encounter
X    - conversions happen only with fixed probability
     - there is a prob. of converting which is inversely proportional to node's
       in-degree (i.e., if you're following a zillion people, it's less likely
       you'll be influenced by each one because that one person only occupies a
       small fraction of the ideas you're exposed to) (??)
         - Question: can/should the "degree of activeness on Twitter" be 
            modeled? (More likely to be influenced the more tweets you see.)
     - different nodes have different "stubbornness" attribute (Yildiz, Acemoglu 2011)
X       - binary
        - continuous
        - different ways to implement stubbornness:
            - migration factor is lower for stubborn nodes
            - BC thresh is lower for stubborn nodes
            - do nodes become stubborn over time?
            - dynamic stubbornness  (stubbornness on an opinion can change
              over time) 
                - stubbornness is sort of inherited from the influencer
                - stubbornness proportional to # of times influenced (on that
                  opinion)
     - disagreement between nodes (Sirbu et al. 2013)

Big question: does the graph change over time??
