model variations:
-----------------

how are opinions represented?
    - binary, or continuous opinions?
    - univariate, or vector opinions? (Deffuant 2000)

how are the vertices that you encounter chosen?
    - pairwise
        - chosen globally (uniformly)
        - chosen from graph neighbors
        - SD/HZ variant: weighted probability between global and neighbors
    - group influence (HK model)

how effectual are encounters?
    - conversions happen on every encounter
    - conversions happen only with fixed probability
    - there is a prob. of converting which is inversely proportional to node's
      in-degree (i.e., if you're following a zillion people, it's less likely
      you'll be influenced by each one because that one person only occupies a
      small fraction of the ideas you're exposed to)
    - different nodes have different "stubbornness" attribute



parameters:
-----------

probability of converting at each step

number of encounters per step

initial condition (opinion distribution within population)
