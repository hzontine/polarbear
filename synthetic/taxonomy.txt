model variations:
-----------------

data:
    - binary, or weighted opinions?
    - univariate, or vector opinions? (Deffuant 2000)

encounters:
    - chosen globally (uniformly), or from graph neighbors?
    - SD/HZ variant: weighted probability from each group

conversions:
    - bi-directional (both encountering agents influence each other), or
      uni-directional?

    - total (outright copy attribute value from influencing node to
      influenced) or partial (drift towards mean)  (maybe binary is always the
      first and weighted is always the second)

    - always successful, or only sometimes? (see "prob of converting," below)

    - prob. of converting: should be inversely proportional to node's
      in-degree? (i.e., if you're following a zillion people, it's less likely
      you'll be influenced by each one because that one person only occupies a
      small fraction of the ideas you're exposed to)



parameters:
-----------

probability of converting at each step

number of encounters per step

initial condition (opinion distribution within population)
