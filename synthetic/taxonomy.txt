model variations:
-----------------

data:
    - binary, or weighted opinions?
    - univariate, or vector opinions? (Deffuant 2000)

encounters:
    - chosen globally (uniformly), or from graph neighbors?
    - SD/HZ variant: weighted probability from each group

conversions:
    - bi-directional (both encountering agents influence each other), or
      uni-directional?

    - total (outright copy attribute value from influencing node to
      influenced) or partial (drift towards mean)

    - always successful, or only sometimes?



parameters:
-----------

probability of converting at each step

number of encounters per step

initial condition (opinion distribution within population)
