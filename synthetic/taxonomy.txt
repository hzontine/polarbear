model variations:
-----------------

how are opinions represented?
    - binary, or continuous opinions? 
        Binary: (Yildiz, Acemoglu 2011)
        Continuous: (Ghaderi, Srikant 2012)
    - univariate, or vector opinions? (Deffuant 2000)

how are the vertices that you encounter chosen?
    - pairwise
        - chosen uniformly from the global graph
        - chosen from graph neighbors (Yildiz, Acemoglui 2011)
        - SD/HZ variant: weighted probability between global and neighbors
    - group influence (HK model)

how effectual are encounters?
    - conversions happen on every encounter
    - conversions happen only with fixed probability
    - there is a prob. of converting which is inversely proportional to node's
      in-degree (i.e., if you're following a zillion people, it's less likely
      you'll be influenced by each one because that one person only occupies a
      small fraction of the ideas you're exposed to)
    - different nodes have different "stubbornness" attribute (Yildiz, Acemoglu 2011)
