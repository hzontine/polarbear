Binary opinions only.
No graph changing (opinion flips is the only dynamic.)
Start with empirical graph (PR) and all indep coin flips for initial opinions.
Test these victim update functions:
    1. Auto update victim from a single (random) neighbor.
    2. Auto update victim from majority opinion of neighbors.
See whether the level of polarization present in empirical graph can be
    achieved by either of these.
If so, declare (limited) victory.
If not, start the graph with assortativity > 0 (HZ's stoch block model idea
    from communities detected.) See how high it has to start in order to reach
    the empirical assortativity. (Two params to sweep here: (1) initial prob
    of red/blue for each cluster, (2) number of clusters we find to start.)
Or...start the initial condition half (or so) with opinions that we actually
    know go with that Twitter user, and the other half (or so) random.
