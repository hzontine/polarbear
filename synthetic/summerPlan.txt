Binary opinions only.
No graph changing (opinion flips is the only dynamic.)
Start with empirical graph with 100 nodes and all indep coin flips for 
initial opinions.
Choose randomly each encounter=FALSE is faster.
Test these victim update functions: ( 100 nodes, 0.05 connected )
    1. Auto update a single random neighbor to your own opinion. 
        [graphA.gif] -- A.is.victim=FALSE 
    2. Auto update influenced by a single random neighbor.    
        [graphB.gif] -- A.is.victim=TRUE
    3. Auto update three random neighbors to your own opinion.
        [graphC.gif] -- A.is.victim=FALSE
    4. Auto update all of your neighbors to your opinion.
        [graphD.gif] -- A.is.victim=FALSE
    5. Auto update victim influenced by the majority opinion of neighbors.
        [graphE.gif] -- A.is.victim=TRUE    majority=TRUE
See whether the level of polarization present in empirical graph can be
    achieved by either of these.
If so, declare (limited) victory.
If not, start the graph with assortativity > 0 (HZ's stoch block model idea
    from communities detected.) See how high it has to start in order to reach
    the empirical assortativity. (Two params to sweep here: (1) initial prob
    of red/blue for each cluster, (2) number of clusters we find to start.)
Or...start the initial condition half (or so) with opinions that we actually
    know go with that Twitter user, and the other half (or so) random.


To do:
1. Run a larger (n=50?) number of trials of 1 vs. 2. Significant difference in
convergence rate? Show boxplot.
2. Ditto, comparing different values for num.vertices (maybe 1 through 5).
3. Ditto, comparing the #2 stuff with "all=TRUE."

Note: make sure that we're measuring time in the same way (i.e., number of
encounters).
