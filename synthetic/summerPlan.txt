Binary opinions only.
No graph changing (opinion flips is the only dynamic.)
Start with empirical graph with 100 nodes and all indep coin flips for 
initial opinions.
Choose randomly each encounter=FALSE is faster.
Test these victim update functions: ( 100 nodes, 0.05 connected )
    1. Auto update a single random neighbor to your own opinion. 
        [graphA.gif] -- A.is.victim=FALSE 
    2. Auto update influenced by a single random neighbor.    
        [graphB.gif] -- A.is.victim=TRUE
    3. Auto update three random neighbors to your own opinion.
        [graphC.gif] -- A.is.victim=FALSE
    4. Auto update all of your neighbors to your opinion.
        [graphD.gif] -- A.is.victim=FALSE
    5. Auto update victim influenced by the majority opinion of neighbors.
        [graphE.gif] -- A.is.victim=TRUE    majority=TRUE
See whether the level of polarization present in empirical graph can be
    achieved by either of these.
If so, declare (limited) victory.
If not, start the graph with assortativity > 0 (HZ's stoch block model idea
    from communities detected.) See how high it has to start in order to reach
    the empirical assortativity. (Two params to sweep here: (1) initial prob
    of red/blue for each cluster, (2) number of clusters we find to start.)
Or...start the initial condition half (or so) with opinions that we actually
    know go with that Twitter user, and the other half (or so) random.


To do:
1. Run a larger (n=50?) number of trials of 1 vs. 2. Significant difference in
convergence rate? Show boxplot.
    todo1.RData  AisVictim.pdf
2. Ditto, comparing different values for num.vertices (maybe 1 through 5).
    
3. Ditto, comparing the #2 stuff with "all=TRUE."

Note: make sure that we're measuring time in the same way (i.e., number of
encounters).

=======
Dave Model definitions:

Dave Model Variant 1: edges to FOAFs are formed conditionally on already
agreeing with that FOAF. We think we get disconnected subgraphs each with 
homogeneous opinions.

Dave Model Variant 2: edges are formed unconditionally. We think we do NOT get
disconnected subgraphs, but we do get community/clustering based on opinion." 



To do for end of SSI!
---------------------
1. Dave model analysis on larger scale:
    - verify that when we have variant 1, we do get all homogenous components.
    - verify that when we have variant 2, we do NOT get all homogenous
      components, but we do get homogeneous clusters.
    Note: if we verify that those two bullets do ALWAYS happen, then the
poster just has the two example graphs, and text stating that we verified that
in n runs of m iterations each, it always happened. If we verify that they
DON'T always happen, then we may need a more quantitative table/plot that
shows (say) the fraction of clusters/components that turned out to be
homogeneous.

2. Look into ways of visualizing the Pelosi-Ryan graph and see if there's a
graphical way to display that on the poster. (Just to show size and
connectedness.)


ABSTRACT

Poster contents:

    A good motivational paragraph on political polarization and why it matters

    Opinion dynamics -- summary of lit (2-4 paragraphs strutting your stuff)
        Maybe even a preliminary taxonomy

    Our findings:
        - sensitive to how encounters are set up
            - Holley vs. Zontine   x
            - influencer vs. influencee   x
        - Dave model   x
    
    Future work:
        Describe empirical data set
        Give basic graph metrics on it

Justifying the dave model:
    - people tend to terminate friendships when they disagree (lit search this)
    - when you agree with someone, you tend to get introduced to and form friendships with FOAFs
    - Noting the differences in behaviors: add edge with FOAF who you disagree with
        cluster_fast_greedy() $memberships
        is it true that all of these are homogeneous?
