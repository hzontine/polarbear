Follow references forward from Friedkin. Are others doing and talking about
    "latent" vs "expressed"

"Hidden Trump vote" phenomenon. (People may not be truthful in responses to
    polls.)



Code
----
1. Add a second attribute to the graph nodes

2. Figure out the cleanest wayS to add a "second encounter function" to the
    main OD loop.

    - A list of encounter functions and a list of update victim functions
      instead of just one of each.

    - Way 2?

    - Way 3?

3. Deal with the fact that update victim functions have to tell the main
    function which attribute (e.g., "expressed" or "latent") of the victim 
    node needs to be changed.

4. Write the new encounter and update victim functions.
