Research Question:

Quantitative and specific: In a situation where one opinion is known to be
socially unpopular, are the two processes we propose (one in-person, one
anonymous) sufficient to explain the observed level of difference between
people's true and expressed opinions?

General exploration: Can we use this model understand why a society
unknowingly will experience a divergence between the majority's true and
expressed opinion?


Dependent Variables:

    GOOD:
- "poll bias": Percentage of PPPs when compared with all those who express
  Popular (HTE)
- Assortativity (when model reaches equilibrium)
    * Find out whether the model does reach equilibrium. If so, then we can
      use this. If not, think about how to characterize "the assortativity of
      the evolving graph" in a single number we can use.

    MEH:
- Time to reach equilibrium
- What is the majority of hidden opinions when "election" day occurs?


Independent Variables:

- The "Unpopularness" of the Unpopular Opinion (probability of faking
  one's expressed opinion if one's hidden opinion is for UC)

- What kind of graph do we have?
    * ER vs Barabasi vs Small World
    * If ER: probability of an initial connection between agents

- Are there more than one kind of agent with regard to Stubbornness
    * If so, what % are stubborn believers?
- Proportion of agents who are Stubborn True Believers 
- Initial Assortativity (do we start off polarized or no, and by how much?)



Definitions:
"true believer" -- an agent whose expressed and hidden match. (You can be an
Unpopular true believer or a Popular true believer.)
"peer pressured person" (PPP) -- an agent who says "Popular" but who thinks
"Unpopular"
"against the grain person" (AGP) -- an agent who says "Unpopular" but who
thinks "Popular." (shouldn't be many of these if the model works right."
