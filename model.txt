Research Question:

In a situation where one opinion is known to be socially unpopular, are the
two processes we propose (one in-person, one anonymous) sufficient to explain
the observed level of difference between people's true and expressed opinions?

Can we use this model understand why a society unknowingly will experience a 
divergence between the majority's true and expressed opinion?


Dependent Variables:

- Discrepancy between the proportion of voters who have hidden preference,
  versus expressed preference, for the Unpopular Candidate
- Assortativity (when model reaches equilibrium)
- Time to reach equilibrium
- What is the majority of hidden opinions when "election" day occurs?


Independent Variables:

- The "Unpopularness" of the Unpopular Candidate (probability of faking
  one's expressed opinion if one's hidden opinion is for UC)
- Probability of an agent to bully someone into hiding their true opinion
  (same as above?)
- Probability of an initial connection between agents
- Proportion of agents who are Stubborn True Believers
