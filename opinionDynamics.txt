What is opinion dynamics?
    - modeling user's latent opinion "to be modulated over time by opinions asynchronously
    expressed by her neighbors as sentiment messgaes" (De et al. 8)
    - "informational influence: users lacking necessary information seek the opinions of their 
    neighbors in order to update their beliefs" (Das, Gollapudi, Munagala 1)
        * Das, G, and M believe this is the dominant model of influence in short-term
        anonymous interactions, ex) chat rooms. 
    - Three types of opinion update processes: (Das, Gollapudi, Munagala 2)
        1) stubbornness- users do not change their opinion
        2) compromise- users update their opinion to be a convex combination of their initial
        opinion and their neighbor's opinion
        3) biased conformity- user takes on the opinions of her surrounding neighbors, 
        ignoring her own inital opinions

Biased Voter Model

    Made up of two basic parameters: 1) to capture stubbornness and 2) biased conformity  
    This model converges a consensus after an exponential amount of time, but the state,
    in which it spends the most time, was observed to be heavily polarized.
    To achieve polarization, existing models required users to ignore opinions that are
    less related to their own and to always be stubborn.
    Opinion Formation: Asch
        - "Asch, in his seminal conformity experiments, observed that a large fraction of 
        his subjects could be swayed to essentially say 'white is black' if everyone else 
        in the group said the same"
        - In his experiments, "the subject was placed in a room with several stooges 
        who unanimously gave the false (binary) response to a question where the 
        true answer was self-evident.
        - Observations: 1) "the extent of conformity (percent of subjects who conform) 
        depends on the size of the group and 2) even when one of the stooges gives 
        the true response, that is sufficient to reduce conformity significantly."
    This model is a combination of certain aspects from the flocking and DeGroot models.
    "We study the response of the subjects not only as a func- tion of the size of the 
    neighborhood, but also as a function of the distribution of these opinions, and 
    the distance of these opinions from the subject’s own"


SLANT Model


The SLANT model is a modeling framework of opinion dynamics in socia media and social networking.
"The proposed framework is based on two intuitive ideas: 1) user's opinions are hidden until 
they decide to share it with their friends and 2) users may update their opinions about a particular 
topic by learning from the opinions shared by their friends." (De et al. 1) 
They modeled user's latent opinions as countinous-time stochastic processes driven by a set of marked
jump stochastic differential equations. Such construction allows each user’s latent opinion to be 
modulated over time by the opinions asynchronously expressed by her neighbors as sentiment message
The Markov property is essential to the main components of the model:
I. "An efficient estimation procedure to find the parameters that maximize the likelihood of a set 
of (millions of) sentiment messages via convex programming.
II. A scalable simulation procedure to sample millions of sentiment messages from the proposed 
model in a matter of minutes.
III. A set of novel predictive formulas for efficient and accurate opinion forecasting, which 
can also be used to identify conditions under which opinions converge to a steady state of 
consensus or polarization." (De et al.)
The model provided a good fit to both the synthetic and real data gathered from Twitter.

Deffuant-Weisbuch Model
Hegselmann-Krause Model


There are two extensively studied models that explore continuous opinion
dynamics under bounded confidence, the Deffuant-Weisbuch (DW) model (Deffuant
et al. 2000) and the Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model (Hegselmann and Krause
2002). 

The DW and HK models are very similar in their use of bounded confidence on a
continuous opinion scale. Differences arise in how an agent aggregates the
opinions around them for consideration in their own opinion shift. With the DW
model, agents aggregate opinions through pairwise evaluations, slightly
shifting an agent’s opinion after looping through all possible pairings within
the population. In the HK model, an agent aggregates all other agent opinions
within their confidence bound and considers the group average for shifting
their opinion (Lorenz 2007)

The HK model is described in Fu, Zhang, and Li (2015).

One of the research conclusions by Fu, Zhang, and Li (2015) through the use of
their MHK model was that closed-minded agents dominated the formation of
opinion consensus. This was supported by simulation results that indicated as
the proportion of closed-minded agents in the population increased (with the
difference being open-minded), so did the number of final opinion clusters
after reaching a period of steady state.
