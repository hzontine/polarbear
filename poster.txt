Opinion Dynamics
    - Discrete vs. continious opinion values
    - Univariate vs. vector of opinions
    - Pairwise interactions vs. group influence
Synthetic Data 
    - A agent holds a univariate or vector of opinions, which is represented by 
    binary or continuous values.
    - At each iteration, one victim is chosen who will interact with either one node, 
        all of it's graph neighbors, or all of the nodes in the graph.
    - We reproduced models from the literature.
        * Ex: Binary Voter Model, DW, HK, BVM with stubborn agents, etc.
        * Will converge to consensus after some amount of time
            - Binary Voter Model: agent adopts a neighbor's opinion
            - Bounded Confidence: if the threshold is large enough
        * Will never reach a fixed state
            - Bounded Confidence: if the threshold is too low
            - Stubborn Agents: never change their own opinions
