Abstract

    Political polarization represents the increasing divergence of opinions between Liberals and Conservatives on the political 
spectrum. As social media fosters an echo-chamber, people tend to form relationships with the like-minded, and break ones with
the opposite. Over time, tight network clusters separated by ideology begin to prevent communication between the political parties
A happy medium between no conversation and total uniformity of opinion is key in cultivating a healthy society. Our task was to 
simulate a network of Twitter users and model their changing political opinions on a graph. We coded a function to take several
parameters, including the initial graph, and produce an animation file of the changing plot over some amount of time. Some methods
other researchers choose to implement did not accurately represent the framework of Twitter. We found a significant difference in the 
length of time before complete consensus of opinion, when the order of interactions between neighbors varies as well as the number of 
users present in the interaction. Opinion dynamics literature cites one micro-behavior, a few stubborn users who never change their 
opinion, as a cause of a macro-behavior, polarization of political ideology. Another macro-behavior, uniformity of opinion, is cited to
always occur for users with binary opinions where each user adopts anotherâ€™s opinion. This fall, we plan to study real Twitter users who 
follow politicians and are politically active. Once we have constructed an accurate political text classifier, we can label users according 
to their tweets. Recording the dynamic relationships of these users through the upcoming election will allow us to study the effect of 
observed micro-behaviors on the dataset.


Political Polarization

    Political Polarization is an observed phenomenon which occurs when public opinion diverges on the political spectrum, leaving only two 
parties with extreme, stubborn values. With the creation of social networking, people now have the ability to build a personal profile, 
choose who they wish to follow, and decide how frequently they wish to visit the site. Each person can choose how much or how little he/she
wishes to share about his/her own personal beliefs online. Homophily is a tendency humans have to associate themselves with others who have
similar opinions and beliefs. If two friends agree on one issue and follow each other, it is highly probable one may directly or indirectly
influence the other into adopting his/her opinion on another issue. Over time, politically active users have been observed to aggregate 
into communities of interest, which allows confirmation bias to be reinforced and selective news to go undisputed. When public opinion is
polarized, it becomes increasingly difficult for the parties to compromise on solutions for pressing national issues.

Opinion Dynamics

    The study of how people formulate and change their own opinion based on the opinions of others is essential to the field of Opinion Dynamics.
In order to model a population of users as a graph, each Twitter user must be represented as a vertex, also known as a node, on the graph. The 
relationship between two users on Twitter can be unidirectional (one follows the other) or bidirectional (they both follow each other), and thus
must be depicted as either an arrow or a line respectively. The arrow is always directed from followee to the follower in order to portray the 
direction of information flow. The political ideology for each user can be modeled as either univariate or multivariate, where each opinion value 
is either discrete or continuous. 
The most studied is univariate binary..
 


    - How vertices influence each other: Pairwise interactions, or group
      influence?
    - "Who is my neighbor?" is it the whole population, or a subset?
    - Other modeling features: stubbornness, bounded confidence

Simulating Opinion Dynamics
    - (might be worth saying: "some modeling choices (simplifications) make it
      so simulation is not necessary -- you can actually analytically work it
      all out" We're not choosing to make the math easy.)
    - Two reasons to simulate a model:
        a. To determine whether certain micro-behaviors are sufficient to
           produce known macro-observations. ("backwards")
        b. To determine the macro-consequences of certain micro-behaviors.
           ("forwards")
      In our case:
        a. What modeling assumptions will produce the phenomena we see today
           in the political sphere? (entrenched polarization; alignment on
           seemingly diverse issues)
        b. In a politically polarized population, what "interventions" might
           be effective to mitigate that polarization?

    - We reproduced models from the literature.
        * Ex: Binary Voter Model, DW, HK, BVM with stubborn agents, etc.
        * Will converge to consensus after some amount of time
            - Binary Voter Model: agent adopts a neighbor's opinion
            - Bounded Confidence: if the threshold is large enough
        * Will never reach a fixed state
            - Bounded Confidence: if the threshold is too low
            - Stubborn Agents: never change their own opinions
    - Our findings
        - sensitive to how encounters are set up
        - Dave model
