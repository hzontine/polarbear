Political Polarization
    - The great debate

Models of Opinion Dynamics
    - Modeling a population of users as a graph
    - What edges represent (briefly mention directed vs undirected)
    - Representing the opinion itself: discrete or continuous? univariate or
      multivariate? 
    - How vertices influence each other: Pairwise interactions, or group
      influence?
    - "Who is my neighbor?" is it the whole population, or a subset?
    - Other modeling features: stubbornness, bounded confidence

Simulating Opinion Dynamics
    - (might be worth saying: "some modeling choices (simplifications) make it
      so simulation is not necessary -- you can actually analytically work it
      all out" We're not choosing to make the math easy.)
    - Two reasons to simulate a model:
        a. To determine whether certain micro-behaviors are sufficient to
           produce known macro-observations. ("backwards")
        b. To determine the macro-consequences of certain micro-behaviors.
           ("forwards")
      In our case:
        a. What modeling assumptions will produce the phenomena we see today
           in the political sphere? (entrenched polarization; alignment on
           seemingly diverse issues)
        b. In a politically polarized population, what "interventions" might
           be effective to mitigate that polarization?

    - We reproduced models from the literature.
        * Ex: Binary Voter Model, DW, HK, BVM with stubborn agents, etc.
        * Will converge to consensus after some amount of time
            - Binary Voter Model: agent adopts a neighbor's opinion
            - Bounded Confidence: if the threshold is large enough
        * Will never reach a fixed state
            - Bounded Confidence: if the threshold is too low
            - Stubborn Agents: never change their own opinions

Emperical Data
    - How was the data collected?
    - How was the seed set chosen?
    - What constraints did we inflict during data collection?
    - Compare and contrast graph metrics between our graphs.

        - Training Data
            * Manually labeled tweets thanks to our fellow SSI students
        - Test Data
        - How accurate were our predictions?
