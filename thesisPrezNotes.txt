get first sentences together
more talky, less read-y. don't spell out complex sentences. "A high poll bias
    can occur..."  "In conclusion, this model suggests..."
think it through lots.
you're a better speaker than this

1 - 11:25  mention CPSC a little more (and on slide)

2 - 11:25  stumbly   a little fast for this slide

3 - 11:26  define "agent".  don't mention the pubs verbally

4 - 11:27  examples of opinions -- good  ("like dogs" lol)
            "consider your own opinions, and how others have influenced you"

5 - 11:28  too read-y

6 - 11:28  relate to them. "consider...do you sometimes conceal your true
            opinion?"
            use words "conceal" and "reveal"
            "want to be liked" -- reword. 
            "asymmetrical" -- streamline.

7 - 11:30  D'Aprile -- say "minority" instead of black

8 - 11:31  

9 - 11:32

10 - 11:32

11 - 11:33++  work on this one a LOT

12 - 11:33  define "binary"
            "has been proven to always converge"
            better explain "uniformity"

13 - 11:34  "My extension of the BVM is..."
            make sure to point to inside and outside
            maybe skip the "BVM has no edges" thing.

14 - 11:35  "we have an erdos-renyi graph"

15, 16 -- 11:36  "one parameter we'll tweak is..."

17 - 11:36++  "two processes, or ways in which agents interact"
            first bullet needs more explanation
            process -> interactions?

18 - 11:37  explain why "only share their latent opinion"

19 - 11:38  "note the external doesn't come into play here"

20 - 11:38  explain why only graph neighbors

21 - 11:39  mention "assume social stigma goes in the pro-blue direction"

22 - 11:39  

23 - 11:39  a common technique in simulation is to set parameters to their
            extremes and validate behavior

24 - 11:41++

25 - 11:41  "I'm defining 'poll bias' as..."
            "Suppose this were the situation running up to the election."
26 - 11:41  

27 - 11:42  

28 - 11:43

more time on all these
30/31 - 11:43  Need "results" signal loudly.
            Explain more about what you're looking at. "Each dot is one
            simulation run..."
            More deliberately stress the result.

32/33 - 11:44

34/35 - 11:45  "it doesn't help..." good start, but reword

36/37 - 11:46  don't explain the ".1 to 1" thing.  "larger social circles"

38 - 11:47   way less read-y

39 - 11:48  future directions
