To verify $H_{1a}$ and $H_{2a}$, we generate a large number of initial graphs
according to the process described in section~\ref{sec:initialization}, using
a range of values of $h$ and $a$, and measure their assortativity.
Figure~\ref{fig:initialPolarization} shows a box plot of the results of
generating 1000 such graphs for each combination of six accessibility values
and six homophily values. (For these and all other results in this paper, $N$
was set to 50 agents and $I$ to 3 ideologies.) As expected, the polarization
of these initial graphs clearly increases with both $h$ and $a$, establishing
$H_{1a}$ and $H_{2a}$.
