\subsection{Two sources of friendship}

Consider for a moment the friendships you have had with others through which
meaningful mutual influence takes place. In broad terms, these relationships
can be thought of as coming from two different kinds of sources. In the first,
you did not encounter the acquaintances by specifically seeking them out --
they were rather thrust into your presence by circumstances. As a child, there
were other children down the street, and fellow students in your 1st-grade
classroom. When you were older, there were dormitory hall-mates, new neighbors
in new neighborhoods, and co-workers. Some of these people who by happenstance
wandered into your field of view, you formed meaningful friendships with.
Others you did not. But the key point that distinguishes them from the second
group is that you did not discover them by seeking out any of their
attributes. Instead, a minuscule set of people (out of all the people in the
world) simply fell into your lap. And from that set, you became meaningful
friends with some.

The second group consists of those you encountered \textit{because} you had
something in common, and you discovered them because you deliberately sought
that something. Even before the advent of cheap, electronic communication this
occurred: people attended churches and synagogues, knowing they would find
others with similar worldviews. They joined rotary clubs, parent-teacher
organizations, and political parties, seeking out those with similar
interests. In the Internet age, this is multiplied tenfold. Anyone with any
view or interest, no matter how esoteric, can find a chatroom, website, Google
group, subreddit, Twitter community, or other form of online clique devoted to
it. For the younger generation especially, this is an important group: recent
surveys suggest that a majority of American teens form meaningful friendships
online, and communicate with them daily, often never meeting the friend
physically.\cite{amanda_lenhart_teens_2015}

The key point is that some of your friends were ``chosen" from a very tiny
subset of the people in the world who you couldn't help but run into. You
might not have had anything in particular in common with them, other than
geographical proximity. The others, however, you drew from a very large pool
-- essentially the entire online world.\footnote{Note that once a relationship
has been established, the partners may never again actively consider the
source of the friendship: a link has simply been made, regardless of the
cause, and thereafter results in mutual influence.} And the tools of the
Internet give you breathtaking precision with which to find and select such
friends.

\subsection{``Accessibility"}

Admittedly, these two sources of friendship are idealized points along a
continuum. Any individual relationship may have been formed due to some blend
of the two. Nevertheless, it is a useful abstraction, and implies the
existence of a key model parameter: the relative strength of the two sources
in leading to friendships. Put another way: on average, what fraction of a
person's friendships develop as a result of geographical proximity and
happenstance encounters, versus being due to more distant relationships where
parties sought each other out based on some shared attribute? 

In the language of this paper, we use the term \textbf{local} to describe
friendships of the first sort, and \textbf{global} for the second. In our
model we are concerned with the relative likelihood of friendships developing
from each of these two sources, and we denote as the society's
\textbf{accessibility} $A$ ($0 \leq A \leq 1$) the fraction of relationships
that have \textit{global} origination. A society with $A$ of 0 presents no way
for its citizens to discover anyone outside the local social circle they
happened to inherit. Persons in a society with $A=1$, by contrast, have no
tendency to form friendships with those ``nearby" them any more than with
anyone else in the world; it is as if their entire experience took place
through the Internet, with equal access to all others, and the ability to
search for others based on their attributes, but with all geographic
information hidden.

For simplicity, we model $A$ as a constant value throughout a society, rather
than having a different value for each agent (as it certainly has in reality).
Presumably the $A$ of the western world in 2017 is lower than the $A$ of
thirty years ago. The question of this paper is how this might bear on
ideological polarization.

\subsection{The reality of homophily}

One might expect that as the accessibility $A$ of a society increases, so
would the diversity of viewpoints its citizens are exposed to. After all, a
higher $A$ means that more of a person's friendships will be drawn from the
entire global field, giving them a much broader range of exposure to people
with many different views and interests.

Arguing against that outcome, however, is an indisputable fact about human
nature: \textit{homophily}. One of the most reliable and long-standing
observations in social psychology, homophily simply refers to the tendency for
people to prefer others who are similar to them.\cite{mcpherson_birds_2001}
This is true across many different aspects of ``similarity," whether it be
race, age, religion, occupation, political affiliation, values, or common
interests. Given the choice of forming ties with several individuals, people
tend to choose the one(s) whom they perceive as being most like them. 

A greater number of choices of friends, therefore, may well lead to
\textit{less} diversity within one's social circle if the homophily factor is
significant. As with accessibility, we model the homophily $H$ of a group of
agents as a single value, $0 \leq H \leq 1$ that controls friendship choices.
In this case, a $H$ of 0.5 is \textit{neutral}: agents in the model have no
preference for or against friendships with similar agents. At the extreme of
$H=1$, agents will always choose an agent similar to them, if possible, and at
$H=0$, they will always choose a \textit{dis}similar agent. (This situation
could be termed ``extreme anti-homophily," or simply ``extreme heterophily.")

The interplay of these two parameters $A$ and $H$ and their impact on the
polarization of a society is the subject of this paper.



\subsection{A healthy society}



One might think that decreased cost and increased availability of diverse
opinions would lead to broader accessibility and hence less echo-chamber thinking.


In this work, we study assortativity as the key measure of polarization. We
don't care how extreme someone's views are -- that's okay -- we just care
whether they are only exposed to others of that sort.
