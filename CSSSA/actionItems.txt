Action items:
-------------
HZ - write code to set the seed first thing in param.sweep(), then generate
    all 200 graphs and color them (assign initial opinions), then run all 200
    sims with those 200 graphs as the initial conditions.
HZ - Make sure all graphs are connected. 
SD - Terminate sim.opinion.dynamics() when convergence happens. Don't ever
    terminate otherwise.
HZ - collect results for A vs B vs C vs D
HZ - Experimental design
SD - Results: result of var 1
SD - Results: result of var 2
SD - Results: A vs B vs C vs D
SD - Discussion/Conclusion
