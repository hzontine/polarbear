\begin{abstract}
We present an agent-based model to explore the causes of one aspect of
ideological polarization: the extent to which members of a society have social
ties only with those they agree with. Specifically, we look at two variables
that affect how an artificial social network structure is built:
\textit{homophily}, or the preference of individuals to form connections with
others of the same ``kind"; and \textit{accessibility}, or the ease with which
agents can form connections to others distant from it, as opposed to only
local agents in its immediate vicinity. Our model builds a graph according to
these two parameters, and then executes the classic Binary Voter Model (BVM)
process on it whereby connected nodes influence one another's opinions. We
find that counter to our original hypothesis, increasing the society's
accessibility decreases its polarization, especially for high levels of
homophily. Also, we discover that the rate at which agents form and dissolve
friendships during the simulation plays a nuanced role in the way the society
evolves.
