\section{EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN}

HZ, write this section.

\subsection{Independent variables}

Concisely describe the indep vars, in a manner consistent with model.tex (use
the terms "selection with replacement," "node influences neighbor," etc.)


\subsection{Dependent variables}

Concisely describe our dep variable: "time (# iter) to convergence" and
explain what that means

\subsection{Other parameters}

Mention other relevant things. These include:

how many tests you ran of each: 
group, how many nodes there were, how you used ER and what the prob of an edge
was, how many iterations you maxed out at, what the init prob was of red vs
blue, and whatever else you think a reader would want to know
