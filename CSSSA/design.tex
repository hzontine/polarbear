\section{EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN}

Our model was constructed to manipulate two implementation choices in order
to observe the effect different combinations have our control variable, time.

\subsection{Independent variables}

One of our experimental variables depends on the order agents are selected 
for interactions: with or without replacement. Our second variable differs 
according to the direction of influence: whether the nodes influence their 
neighbors or their neighbors influence them.

\subsection{Dependent variables}

To compare our two independent variables, we must measure the amount of time that
passes before all agents in the graph have the same binary opinion. Specifically,
we chose to count the number of pairwise encounters that occur before uniformity
of opinion among all agents. The simulation was set up to run through an infinite 
number of interactions and only terminate when uniformity was reached.

Our simulation was run for 200 trials. 

With a seed set, 200 initial Erdos Renyi graphs were created with 100 nodes each
and a       probability of connectedness. We used the same 200 initial graphs to
start the simulation for all combinations of the two independent variables. Each
graph was randomly assigned one of two opinion attributes.
