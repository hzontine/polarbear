HZ, write this section.

\subsection{Independent variables}

Concisely describe the indep vars, in a manner consistent with model.tex (use
the terms "selection with replacement," "node influences neighbor," etc.)


\subsection{Dependent variables}

Concisely describe our dep variable: "time (# iter) to convergence" and
explain what that means

The measurement is number of iterations to complete uniformity of opinion
among the agents in the graph.


After one simulation of our model, we can record the iteration where the model
reached a consensus.
 the dependent variable which our model record

\subsection{Other parameters}

Mention other relevant things. These include:

how many tests you ran of each: 200 trials 

We created 200 inital Erdos Renyi graphs with 100 nodes each. After much consideration,
we assigned a 0.06 probability of connectedness to all of the graphs. In a graph
with 100 agents, most nodes will probably be connected to six other people. We 
used the same 200 inital graphs to run the simulation with all combinations of
the independent variables.
