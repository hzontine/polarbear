    (Do the *'s first)

IV
*How efficacious is each type of encounter? (For online, it's prob of
    Conversion. For in-person, it's prob of Knuckle under, and prob of
    Internalizing)

    Simplification for now: make K and I be the same, and C + K&I = 1.0.

Each iteration, how many graph neighbors do you encounter vs. how many
    mean-field (online) neighbors do you encounter?

Order and size of the graph


DV
*Percent genuineness over time (expressed=hidden)
    (break it down by color)
    Confusion matrix Snapshot (at several points? at iteration 1000, 2000, 
        and 3000, say?)
    Count (1) how many blue/blues, (2) how many blue/reds, (3) how many
        red/blues, and (4) how many red/reds.

*Max percentage of people who ever had the eventually losing opinion

*Conversion rate (# of encounters to unanimity)

Measuring polarization
    - Assortativity by opinion
    - How frequent are opinion changes
