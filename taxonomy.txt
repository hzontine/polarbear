How are opinions represented?
-----------------------------
    - univariate 
X       Binary: (Yildiz et al. 2013) (Folmer 1974) (Weisbuch and Boudjema 1999)
           * Binary Voter Model: (Holley and Liggett 1975) and (Clifford and Sudbury 1973)
X       Discrete:
X       Continuous: (Ghaderi, Srikant 2012)   (Deffuant 2000) (Weisbuch et al. 2001)
    - vector of opinions
        Binary: (Deffuant 2000)
        Continuous: (Sirbu et al. 2013) 
    - Friedkin variant: you have a "hidden/latent" opinion that may differ from your expressed opinion


Which vertices influence you?
-----------------------------
    - do you interact with the whole graph, or with just neighbors?
        - whole graph: DeGroot; HK; DW; Weisbuch
        - graph neighbors: Clifford; Holley; Yildiz; Follmer
        - (note: SD/HZ variant: weighted probability between global and neighbors)
    - do you choose randomly from this set, or do you interact with the entire set?
        - whole set at once: DeGroot; HK
        - pairwise at a time: Clifford; Holley; DW; Yildiz; Weisbuch
        - is the victim randomly chosen first, then influencer, or the other
          way around?
    (note: no examples of interacting with just neighbors and all at once.)


How effectual are encounters?
-----------------------------
    1. What is the probability of the victim converting?
X    - conversions happen on every encounter
X    - conversions happen only with fixed probability
     - SD/HZ variant: there is a prob. of converting which is inversely proportional to node's
       in-degree (i.e., if you're following a zillion people, it's less likely
       you'll be influenced by each one because that one person only occupies a
       small fraction of the ideas you're exposed to) (??)
         - Question: can/should the "degree of activeness on Twitter" be 
            modeled? (More likely to be influenced the more tweets you see.)
     - different nodes have different "stubbornness" attribute (Yildiz, Acemoglu 2011)
X       - binary (Yildiz)
        - continuous (?)
        - different ways to implement stubbornness:
            - stubborn nodes are just plain infinitely stubborn (Yildiz)
            - HZ/SD: BC thresh is lower for stubborn nodes
        * continuous only:
     - "bounded confidence" (HK,DW) -- conversions only happen if difference of opinion is below threshold

    2. What happens on a conversion?
     * discrete only:
         - flip to influencer's opinion
         - multiple influencers (probably a vertex's set of neighbors): flip to
           "majority rule" (higher threshold than 50% to change vs. stay?)
         - vector opinions only: some subset of your opinions flip
         - (SD's dumb idea: flip to opposite of influencer's opinion)
     * continuous only:
         - "move partway"
             - HZ/SD: migration factor (maybe lower for stubborn nodes)
         - "disagreement" (divergence of opinions after an interaction) between nodes (Sirbu et al. 2013)
    

Which way does influence go?
----------------------------
        - unidirectional influence for each encounter
        - bidirectional (DW)

Big question: does the graph change over time??


Initial condition:
------------------
    - What kind of graph is it? (ER, Barabasi, empirical, etc.)
    - How are the initial opinions distributed? (All indep, stoch block model
      to impose some assortativity, etc)




Future work:
    - HZ/SD: dynamic stubbornness  (stubbornness on an opinion can change
      over time) 
        - do you become stubborn randomly? (coin flip each turn if
          stubbornness=binary, or uptick in stubbornness if cont.)
        - stubbornness is sort of inherited from the influencer
        - stubbornness proportional to # of times influenced (on that
          opinion)
        - do you become increasingly stubborn when you interact with
          people of opposite (or same) opinion and don't change? (so
          instead of related to time, it's related to 
          num-of-interactions-w/o-changing)


The known ways to avoid uniformity in the model:
------------------------------------------------
1. Bounded confidence (low threshold)
2. Stubbornness
3. Innate opinion != expressed opinion (Friedkin & SLANT are two different ways of doing this)




parameters:
-----------

probability of converting at each step

number of encounters per step

initial condition (opinion distribution within population)



Big things we haven't seen:
---------------------------

The graph updating at all (i.e. homophily, or any other effect, driving edges)

Stubbornness increasing with age

choose sometimes from entire population, sometimes from graph neighbors.
