			§ -0.142
			§ the mixing is no different from that obtained through random assignment of edges that preserves the marginal degree distribution.
		○ Hair Length
			§ continuous
			§ 0.3868
			§ While there is a tendency for vertices of high degrees to link with similar vertices, vertices of lower degree tend to link with vertices of both lower and higher degrees
