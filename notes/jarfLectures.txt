- Sentiment Analysis (aka opinion extraction, opinion mining, sentiment mining, subjectivity analysis)
	○ attributes / aspects & sentiment
	○ definition: detection of attitudes, enduring colored beliefs dispositions towards objects or persons
		§ holder (source) of attitude
		§ target (aspect) of attitude
		§ types of
			□ from a set of types (like, love, hate, desire etc)
			□ weighed polarity (positive, negative, neutral)
		§ text containing the attitude which can be a sentence or an entire document
	○ Baseline algorithm
		§ tokenization
		§ feature extraction
		§ using different classifiers
			□ Naive Bayes: how likely are we to see a positive movie review X for each position in the document, how likely is that word to have been expressed by a positive movie review
			□ Logistic regression, support vector machines SVM
- Text Classification
	○ Hand written rules based on combinations of words
	○ Expensive to build and maintain even though can be super accurate
	○ Machine Learning: maps a document to a class
- Naive Bayes
	○ Bag of words assumption: assume position doesn’t matter
	○ conditional independence: assume the feature probabilities are independent given the class c   [  P(x ^i | c ^j )
	○ Add 1 smoothing
- Precision: of the things you are selecting what % of them are correct? 
	○ # of true positives / true pos + false pos
- Recall: of the things that are correct, what % of them did you find?
	○ # of true positives / true positives + false neg

	Correct	Not Correct
selected	True Positive	False Positive
Not selected	False Negative	True Negative

- Precision vs Recall: opposites, trade off / balances
	○ If you increase recall, you'll make more mistakes which will drop your precision
	○ How important is precision vs having a high recall?
- F measure : weighted harmonic mean
	○ Take the reciprocal of two quantities, add them and then take the reciprocal of that
	○ Very conservative average
	○ Balanced F1 measure: Beta = 1 and alpha = 1/2
	○ F = 2PR/(P+R)
