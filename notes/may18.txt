- Lit Review Help
	○ Political polarization from a graph point of view / social network of a Twitter graph / degree of the polarization
	○ How to characterize the amount of political polarization // over time
	○ Dynamic network as it changes
	○ Point of no return?
	○ Sentiment analysis: classic algorithms and well established results determining if tweets are positive or negative (only tweets with specific keywords)
	○ Is polarization real?
		§ We have to prove it is not a myth!
		§ Find articles that discuss both arguments
- People to talk to: Elizabeth and Jessica
	○ Fellow path: PhD, 5 years, school paid for, small stipend
- Dynamical system: similar to system dynamics, but not
- Scale Free Network: degree distribution follows a power law
	○ Exponential - assumes the probability will hit 0, discounts wild-cards
	○ Power law- allows for outliers
		§ little cities, medium, some big ones, and [New York / Tokyo]
		§ Fat tail: Justin Biebers of the world
- Preferential Attachment: theory about how social networks grow
	○ As nodes are added to a network, they will attach themselves in a way that the probability of connecting to any existing node in the graph is proportional to that node's degree
	○ Success to the successful, rich get richer
	○ Erdos-Renyi: leads to the power rule, Biebers make up the fat tail
	○ Preferential attachment can lead to the power law but not backwards
