Variations on the model we should do eventually:
------------------------------------------------

The Dave model (dynamic graph)

The Stephen model (vector of opinions; presumably converge to "package")

"Soft" stubbornness

Hannah's degree-based influence (the more neighbors you have, the less you're
    influenced by each one)

Initial graph: Erdos-Renyi vs. Barabasi
